# Data and scripts for Gann and Barr (2014)

Citation:

Gann, T., & Barr, D. J. (2014).  Speaking from experience: Audience design as expert performance.  *Language, Cognition, and Neuroscience*, *29*, 744--760.

A preprint of the paper is included in the archive (`GannBarrPreprint.pdf`).

Each of the R scripts performs a different analysis (compare with results shown in Table 1 of the paper).  Not all analyses have been added to the archive; the remaining analyses will be added soon.

These are not the original scripts, which used an earlier version of `lme4` (0.999375-33).  The scripts were re-written (for pedagogical purposes) to work with the latest version of `lme4` (1.1-7).  The results are very close to those presented in the paper.

## R scripts:

-`conventional_modifier_use.R`

-`conventional_speech_onset_latency.R`

-`unconventional_speech_onset.R`

-`unconventional_word_count.R`

## R data files:

-`crefs.rds`: conventional referents                   

-`urefs.rds`: data for unconventional referents

-`urefs_coding.rds`: coding of unconventional descriptions
